## PPR Rocker Switch

Rocker switches are everyday appliances to control devices, like lights or sun-blinds. The Rocker Switch use case illustrates the functional design of a Cyber-Physical Production System producing rocker switches. The repository contains an excerpt of the functional design in the PPR DSL.

The use case stems from an analysis of a Cyber-Physical Production System design from a cooperation with an industry partner, showing an abstracted design to honor intellectual property rights.
